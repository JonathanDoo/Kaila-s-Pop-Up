    <h1>About Kaila</h1>
    <p class="text">Greetings, my name is Kaila Dooley, 
        a young African American woman born and raised 
        in Compton. As you may notice, I am different 
        from everyone else. Some know me as being quiet, 
        especially those who knew me during my 10th–12th 
        grade years, while others know me as the person 
        they can count on when things go left, when someone 
        doesn’t show up, or when help is needed. For most 
        people, I am known as someone who never says no.
    </p>
    <p class="text">|</p>
    <p class="text">|</p>
    <p class="text">|</p>
    <p class="text">For those who do not really know me, I am someone 
        who loves to cook and write, and I enjoy trying 
        new things when they look fun or learning skills 
        that can benefit my life and my family. I am 
        family-oriented, deeply connected to my community, 
        and a Christian who has been going to church since 
        I was one year old with my mom. When COVID came 
        around, I became scared after seeing the negative 
        sides of people, which caused me to retreat into 
        my shell for a period of my life. One day, I 
        finally decided that enough was enough, and that 
        decision led me to begin my culinary journey.
    </p>
    <p class="text">|</p>

    <p class="text">I started cooking because it came easily to me after 
        receiving bad news back to back. I began cooking in 
        my double-digit years, and it became a coping mechanism 
        for me. At first, cooking was not my main outlet, writing 
        was, and it still is — but over time, cooking became more 
        of a live, laugh, and love space. I did not give up writing; 
        I simply became more involved with cooking. While I still 
        love writing, cooking helped me in ways I needed at t
        hat time.
    </p>

    <p class="text">As my family began telling me my food was good, 
        I started sharing it with others. They tried it and loved it, 
        and seeing the joy and enjoyment people got from my food 
        encouraged me to expand my culinary skills. I began making 
        Italian dishes, then steaks — which I jokingly call “rich 
        people food” because of how expensive they can be. From there, 
        I started learning American and Asian cuisines. Today, I cook 
        because it is fun, it brings me peace of mind, and it allows 
        me to be myself.
    </p>

    <p class="text">My goal is to own my own business and open 
        restaurants around the world. I want people everywhere to 
        experience homemade food, especially those who decide to 
        settle and live far from where they started. Through my cooking, 
        I hope to give people a sense of comfort, connection, and home.
