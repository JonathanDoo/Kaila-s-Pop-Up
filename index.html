                        Greetings, my name is Kaila Dooley, a young 
                        African American woman born and raised in Compton. 
                        While some know me as quiet, especially during my 
                        10th–12th grade years, others know me as someone 
                        dependable who never says no and is always willing 
                        to help. I am family-oriented, deeply connected to 
                        my community, a Christian since the age of one, and 
                        someone who loves cooking, writing, and learning new 
                        things that benefit my life and family. After COVID 
                        caused me to retreat into my shell, I chose to step 
                        forward by beginning my culinary journey, where 
                        cooking brought me peace of mind and became the 
                        missing piece to my puzzle.

    <p class="text">I started cooking because it came 
        easily to me, especially after receiving bad news 
        back to back. Cooking became my safe haven, a space 
        where I could just be myself. I began during my 
        teenage years, I don’t remember the exact time, 
        and it eventually transformed into a coping mechanism. 
        Everyone has something, and at first, cooking wasn’t 
        mine. Writing was, and it still is. However, cooking 
        became more of a live, laugh, and love space for me. 
        I didn’t completely let go of writing; I simply became 
        more involved with cooking. Don’t get me wrong, I still 
        love writing, but cooking helped me in a different way. 
        As my family began telling me my food was good, I started 
        sharing it with others. They tried it, loved it, and seeing 
        the joy and enjoyment people got from my food pushed me 
        to expand my culinary repertoire. I began making Italian 
        dishes, then steaks, what I like to call “rich people food,” 
        because do you know how much one costs? From there, I started 
        learning American and Asian dishes. Now, I cook because it’s 
        fun, and because I can truly be myself while doing it.

    <p class="text"> My long term goal is to own my own
        business and establish restaurants around the world. 
        I want to create spaces where people from all 
        backgrounds can experience the comfort of homemade 
        food, especially those who choose to make a new home 
        far from where they started. No matter where someone 
        s in the world, I want my food to offer a sense of 
        warmth, familiarity, and belonging. Through my restaurants, 
        I hope to share more than just meals, I want to share culture, 
        love, and the feeling of home. Food has the power to connect 
        people, and my dream is to use that power to bring comfort 
        and joy to individuals and families everywhere. Whether 
        someone is visiting, relocating, or settling down for good, 
        I want them to always be able to find a place that feels 
        like home through my cooking.
